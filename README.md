# Testing-IT-Systems-Lab-2
LTU Course Testing of IT Systems, Lab 2

Teacher Todd is Looking for Testers, for this Assignment

Teacher Todd is looking for testers who will test this assignment before it is released to all students.  If you are interested, please contact Todd at Todd.Booth@Ltu.Se.  

## Introduction

The first group lab was the Java unit testing.  This second group lab is to create several test environments and to load various test data.  We will create test environments in the public cloud since that is the most common method of creation.  We will use Amazon AWS since they give away free student accounts.  Students can work in groups of 2-3.  Only one student in each group needs to create an Amazon AWS student account.  Todd has provided many YouTube tutorial links.  If you find a better tutorial, just let Todd know and he’ll update this for the other students.

## Canvas Groups

Even though this is a group assignment, students will submit their own version of the assignment reflections as an individual assignment.  In the assignment, please start with an introduction which states who were the other students in the group who worked together.  So, Teacher Todd does not require you to create Canvas groups, but you can if you wish.  If you wish to create a group, the best way to find group buddies is by attending lectures and using the Canvas chat.

## Work in Study Group via Zoom

The Zoom product allows students to work together.  You can share your screens, and if you wish, you can even allow remove control by the other students.  If you don’t use Zoom, you can use Skype and Google hangs-outs for screen sharing.

## LinkedIn CV/Resume for this Lab Activity

When students complete this lab, here is a short summary of what you can put in your CV/Resume:
In the Testing IT Systems course, I not only learned theoretical and general knowledge, I also learned hands-on practical skills, such as the following:

I learned how to create a virtual test environment using virtual machine guests.  I performed this in the public cloud Amazon AWS.  I then learned how to create a test environment using docker containers to simulate hosts.  I learned how to use Git to exchange files with the developers and operations.  With docker containers, I was able to simulate five Linux hosts in under one megabyte and the docker container systems booted in just a few seconds.  I’ve learned how the scripts work, so that I can apply my knowledge to create new test environments.  I understand how docker hub works, so that I can integrate new servers into a test environment.  Then I learned how to load and reset the SQL data to be used in various test environments.

## Create Amazon AWS student account

Teacher Todd has applied for student accounts, for all students who are in Canvas listed as students.  If you are listed in Canvas as an observer, you will not receive an AWS student account.  After you receive the email request to confirm your account, one student in each group needs to confirm the account request.

Good Luck, Teacher Todd
