# Using Git

This document will help you with a few Git commands.

First, you need to Ssh to your VM Guest on AWS.

You need to download the Lab2 files from GitHub.  You can do that with the following commands:

cd  
git clone github.com:ToddBooth/Lab2 
cd Lab2

From timem to time Todd will update the GitHub files and you need to download the current version.  You can do that with the following commands:

cd ~/Lab2  
git pull  

In general, you should not modify the files you download since they will be overwritten when you download new versions.
So it is better for you to create new files, if that is needed.

Good Luck, Teacher Todd
